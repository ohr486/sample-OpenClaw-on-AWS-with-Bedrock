## Classification Levels
- **Public**: Marketing materials, blog posts, open-source code
- **Internal**: Internal wikis, meeting notes, project plans
- **Confidential**: Customer data, financial reports, HR records
- **Restricted**: Credentials, encryption keys, PII

## Rules
1. Never store Restricted data in plain text
2. Encrypt Confidential data at rest and in transit
3. PII must not appear in logs, chat histories, or AI agent memory files
4. Customer data must stay within the designated AWS region (us-east-2)
5. All data access must be logged and auditable

## AI Agent Specific
- Agents must not store customer PII in MEMORY.md
- Agents must redact sensitive data before responding
- File operations on Confidential/Restricted data require approval

## Authentication
- All systems require MFA
- API keys rotate every 90 days
- Service accounts use IAM roles, not long-lived credentials

## Network
- No public-facing security groups without WAF
- VPC endpoints for AWS services
- All traffic encrypted with TLS 1.2+

## Incident Response
1. Detect → 2. Contain → 3. Eradicate → 4. Recover → 5. Post-mortem

1. All integration tests pass in staging

## Deployment Steps
```bash
# 1. Tag release
git tag -a v1.x.x -m "Release v1.x.x"
git push origin v1.x.x

# 2. Deploy to staging
aws deploy create-deployment --application-name myapp --deployment-group staging

# 3. Verify staging
curl -s https://staging.acme.com/health | jq .status

# 4. Deploy to production (canary)
aws deploy create-deployment --application-name myapp --deployment-group prod-canary

# 5. Full production rollout
aws deploy create-deployment --application-name myapp --deployment-group prod-full
```

## Rollback
If error rate > 1% after deployment:
```bash
aws deploy stop-deployment --deployment-id <id>
aws deploy create-deployment --application-name myapp --deployment-group prod-full --revision previousRevision

## Client
TechCorp — 500-employee SaaS company, $50M ARR

## Challenge
- Legacy on-premise infrastructure (3 data centers)
- 200+ microservices, 50TB data
- Zero-downtime migration requirement

## Solution
- Phased migration over 6 months
- AWS Landing Zone with multi-account strategy
- Database Migration Service for PostgreSQL → Aurora
- Container migration: Docker → ECS Fargate

## Results
- 40% infrastructure cost reduction
- 99.99% uptime during migration
- 3x deployment frequency improvement
- $2M annual savings

## Key Learnings
1. Start with stateless services
2. Database migration is the hardest part — plan extra time
3. Network connectivity (Direct Connect) should be set up first
4. Training the team on AWS is as important as the technical migration
